## Welcome!

I am a graduate student in [Electrical and Computer Engineering at Cornell University](https://www.ece.cornell.edu/).<!--- I have been working under [Prof. Lang Tong](https://people.ece.cornell.edu/ltong/) applying machine learning to state estimation and, previously, under [Prof. Ross Baldick](https://users.ece.utexas.edu/~baldick/) implementing a control for a solar powered water pump that operated off-grid. You can find more about these [here](research-projects.html). My future work involves `<<anything-useful> && <anything-challenging>>`. --->
