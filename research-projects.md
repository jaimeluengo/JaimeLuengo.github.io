## Research Projects

Although it may seem surprising, as a STEM graduate student, I apply Machine Learning to solve problems that entail my area of study. Through my master's and bachelor's thesis I have been involved in both theoritical and practical research projects:

* [Master's Thesis: Deep Neural Networks in the Distribution System](JLuengo_MEng.html)
* [Bachelor's Thesis:  Solar Powered Water Pump](JLuengo_BSc.html)
